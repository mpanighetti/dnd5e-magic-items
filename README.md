## Rules Definitions

### Compatibility

This content was written to be compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition.

### Rule Changes

This document makes the following modifications from _SRD 5.1_ and _SRD 5.2_:

- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on saving throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such saving throws.
- Damage and condition resistance, vulnerability, and immunity are now grouped together as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
- This document adds a new **Instruments** category of magic items, as described in [Rhythmancy: The Magic of Music](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-rhythmancy/blob/main/ch-6-rhythmancy-magic-items.md#magic-item-category-instruments).
- This document offers new options for the Alchemist class by balab.
