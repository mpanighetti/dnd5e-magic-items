## Compatibility

This content was written to be compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It makes the following modifications from _Systems Reference Document 5.1_:

- "Species" is used in place of "race". "Ancestry" or "variant" is used in place of "subrace".
- "Focus Points" is used in place of "Ki Points".
- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on Saving Throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such Saving Throws.
- Damage and condition resistance, vulnerability, and immunity are now grouped together as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
- This document adds a new **Instruments** category of magic items, as described in [Rhythmancy: The Magic of Music](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-rhythmancy/blob/main/ch-6-rhythmancy-magic-items.md#magic-item-category-instruments).
