# Maracas of Holding

_Instrument (maracas), rare (requires Attunement)_

These maracas are filled with dried seeds that clatter when the instruments are shaken, and they seem to have an endless capacity for more seeds.

The _Maracas of Holding_ contain 3 charges. While you are Attuned to the _Maracas of Holding_, you can expend its charges to create one of the following magical effects:

- You can expend 1-3 charges to cast a Rhythmancy spell you know at a cost of one charge per spell level. The maracas regain all charges expended for casting spells at dawn.
- You can expend 1 charge and perform a dance with the maracas for 1 minute to magically imbue a nonmagical bag, backpack, or similar storage item you touch with increased storage capacity, temporarily turning the item into a magic item with the storage properties of a _bag of holding_.

  If the maracas have no charges remaining when you perform this dance, one of the items of your choice that was transformed in this manner is reverted to its original nonmagical form, at which point anything still inside its interior in excess of its normal capacity is expelled. You can restore 1 charge to the maracas by touching an item you transformed in this manner to revert it as a Magic action. Ending Attunement to the _Maracas of Holding_ causes all such items you transformed to be reverted and restores all of the maracas' charges spent for such transformations.
