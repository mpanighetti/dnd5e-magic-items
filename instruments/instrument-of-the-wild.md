# Instrument of the Wild

_Instrument (any), rarity varies (requires Attunement by someone able to cast Rhythmancy spells)_

This instrument was lovingly crafted by an artist with a profound connection to the rhythm of the natural world, and they have imbued some of their own magic into the craft and design. The instrument manifests the magical gift of its creation as one or more Rhythmancy spells. It also contains charges that can be spent to cast these spells at a cost of one charge per spell level. The number of charges vary based on its rarity. The instrument regains 1d4 expended charges at dawn.

An _Instrument of the Wild_ contains one or more spells based on its number of charges and rarity, and an instrument of a higher rarity also includes the spells from all rarities below it (for example, an uncommon _Instrument of the Wild_ includes both _The Lost is Found_ and _Song of Discovery_). At the Dungeon Master's discretion, some of these instruments can be found with replacement imbued spells from the ranger spell list; such spells are a reflection of the person who crafted the instrument and the magical properties they imparted to it, and they are considered Rhythmancy spells for the purpose of casting by expending charges.
