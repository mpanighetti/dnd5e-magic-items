# Manzana Caramelada
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This caramel-covered apple crackles faintly from the sound of bubbling cider infused inside. If you use an action to eat the manzana, you regain 10 (3d6) hit points. Any hit points remaining after you reach your maximum hit points are instead gained as temporary hit points.
