# Dulce de Chile Caótico
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This tiny chocolate is infused with pieces of a pale blue chili pepper which pulsate with wild magic energy. If you use an action to eat the dulce, you gain resistance to fire damage for 1 hour, then immediately roll on the Wild Magic Surge table from the _Player's Handbook_ to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is cast using a Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature of your choice that you have access to, it is too wild to be affected by Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. If you do not have the ability to cast spells normally, any spells cast through this effect use Constitution as your spellcasting ability.
