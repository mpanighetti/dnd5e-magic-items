# Calavera de Azúcar

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This tiny sugar skull is decorated with flowers and bright colors. You can use an action to throw the calavera up to 20 feet. When the calavera lands, it shatters and transforms into un [esqueleto de azúcar](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/constructs/esqueleto-de-azucar.md) (sugar skeleton). Use the stat block on this page to represent the esqueleto when summoned.

The esqueleto is friendly toward you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the esqueleto moves and what action it takes, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the esqueleto follows you and defends itself. The esqueleto lasts until reduced to 0 hit points, upon which it collapses into a pile of sugar dust and is destroyed.
