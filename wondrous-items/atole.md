# Atole

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This ceramic pitcher contains three servings of a warm beverage made from corn meal. If you use an action to drink a serving of atole, you gain immunity to being frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned for 1 hour, ending such conditions immediately if you already have them.
