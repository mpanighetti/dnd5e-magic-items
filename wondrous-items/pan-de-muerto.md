# Pan de Muerto

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This traditional holiday bread always looks and smells as if it were freshly pulled from the oven. If you use an action to eat the pan de muerto, you regain 3 (1d6) hit points at the end of each of your turns for the next minute, and your food and drink requirements are satisfied for the next 1d4 days.
