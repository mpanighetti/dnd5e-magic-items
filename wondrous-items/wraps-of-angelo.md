_Wondrous item, artifact (requires Attunement by a monk), chaotic good_

|  INT  |  WIS  |  CHA  |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|10 (+0)|20 (+5)|10 (+0)|

You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made using your Unarmed Strikes while wearing the _Wraps of Angelo_; this bonus increases to +2 when you reach 9th level, and +3 when you reach 16th level. The wraps have the following additional properties.

_**Psionic Entanglement.**_ The _Wraps of Angelo_ cannot be moved more than 10 feet apart from each other and are considered to be a single magic item.

_**Shared Discipline.**_ The _Wraps of Angelo_ grant you a portion of Angelo's power and mental discipline. The wraps have 5 charges that can be spent on some of the wrap's properties. These charges can also be used as Focus Points, and you can spend and combine them with any Focus Points you already have from another source. The wraps regain 1d6 charges at dawn, but you can also use your Focus Points in place of charges.

_**Infused Strikes.**_ You can enhance your attacks with psionic energy. Each time you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you Grapple a creature, or a creature fails a check to escape your Grapple, you can choose to expend up to 3 charges and roll that number of Martial Arts dice. You deal psychic damage to the target of your Grapple or attack equal to the number rolled.

_**Reactive Healing.**_ You gain the ability to redirect the power of strikes and magical harm into healing energy. As a Reaction when you take damage from a weapon or spell, you can expend up to 5 charges and roll that number of Martial Arts dice. You regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier.

_**Heroic Knowledge.**_ This relic retains all living knowledge of the hero who inhabits it, and can impart you with knowledge of that hero's adventures in ancient times. Once per day, if you spend 10 minutes touching the relic and mentally communing with the soul within, you can cast the _commune_ spell without any material components, targeting the hero as the divine proxy.

_**Sentience.**_ This relic is a sentient artifact; its alignment and ability scores are listed in its attributes. It is unable to sense its surroundings beyond its wielder. The relic can understand Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. While you are Attuned to this relic, it also understands every language you know.

_**Personality.**_ The wraps contain the soul of Angelo, a great hero who voluntarily embodied this artifact to pass on his wisdom to adventurers protecting the Soul Moon. Like Angelo himself, the wraps are driven to strike down fiends without parley.

#### Description

These sienna hand wraps were once worn by a powerful tortle monk named Angelo, who fought alongside the greatest Heroes of the Soul Moon to hold back an invasion of devils during the Incursion of the Hells. When this battle was won, the warrior imparted his consciousness into the wraps, to act as counsel should a new champion be called into action to stop a future catastrophe.

The wraps appear simple and utilitarian, but they faintly crackle with psionic energy that sharply hones the wielder's mind. This energy also binds the two pieces of cloth together, such that they cannot be separated as long as their magic is intact.
