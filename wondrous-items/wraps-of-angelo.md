# Wraps of Angelo

#### Attributes

_Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a monk)_

While wearing these wraps, you gain +1 to attack and damage rolls made using your unarmed strikes; this bonus increases to +2 when you reach 9th level, and +3 when you reach 16th level. Additionally, while you are attuned to the wraps, you gain the following benefits:

- _**Shared Discipline.**_ The warrior whose mind inhabits these wraps grants you a portion of their power. You gain proficiency in History checks, and you gain an additional number of Discipline Points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).
- _**Reactive Healing.**_ You gain the ability to redirect the power of strikes and magical harm into healing energy. As a reaction when you take damage from a weapon or spell, you can spend up to 5 Discipline Points to activate your Quickened Healing (replacing the normal Discipline Point cost). When you heal in this manner, you gain additional hit points, determined by rolling a number of Martial Arts dice equal to the number of Discipline Points spent.

#### Description

These sienna hand wraps were once worn by a powerful tortle monk named Angelo, who fought alongside the greatest heroes of the Soul Moon to hold back an incursion of devils. When this battle was won, the warrior imparted his consciousness into the wraps, to act as counsel should a new champion be called into action to stop a future catastrophe. The wraps appear simple and utilitarian, but they faintly crackle with psionic energy that sharply hones the wielder's mind.
