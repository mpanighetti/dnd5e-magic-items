# Crown of Annelid Affection

#### Attributes

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires Attunement)_

You gain Blindsight to a distance of 30 feet and a Burrow Speed equal to your Movement Speed. Additionally, once per day, you can use a Magic Action to polymorph yourself into a worm (use the statistics of a poisonous snake). While you are in this worm form, creatures within 30 feet that can see you at the start of their turn must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom Saving Throw or be Charmed by you until the start of their next turn or until you revert into your normal form. You remain in this worm form until you lose Concentration, until you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until you revert to your normal form as a Magic Action.

#### Description

This crown is inset with dark gems and is composed of dozens of intertwined copper strands in the shape of segmented worms.
