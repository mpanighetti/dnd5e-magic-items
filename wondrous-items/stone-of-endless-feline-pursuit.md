# Stone of Endless Feline Pursuit

_Wondrous Item, Legendary_

The product of a _Wish_ made by the displacer beast Waver, this tiny stone can provide magical entertainment for cats and similar creatures everywhere. The stone is smooth and has a thumb-sized depression on one side. A creature who holds the stone and presses their thumb or similar digit or appendage in the depression can cast _Prestidigitation_ as a Magic action to create a point of red light on a surface they can see. This point of light can then be moved by aiming the stone in any direction. The spell persists until the wielder stops pressing the depression.
