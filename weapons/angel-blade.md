# Angel Blade

#### Attributes

**Angel Blade**
 
_Weapon (longsword), rare, requires attunement_
 
These silvery blades are standard issue for all frontline celestial soldiers in a god's army. They are similar in appearance to a mortal sword, but have been blessed with holy energies to effectively smite unbelievers.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit a celestial, fiend, or evil-aligned creature with the angel blade, the attack is a critical hit and ignores damage resistance for all damage dealt as part of the attack.

#### Description

Even after falling from grace, an angel will typically retain ownership of their angel blade, a powerful weapon designed to pierce evil hearts. It is perhaps a slight oversight of the blade's creators that it is equally effective against other angels, and that this power persists even in the hands of mortals. A rare person that comes across an angel blade will find themself in possession of a mighty power to wield against any foe.
