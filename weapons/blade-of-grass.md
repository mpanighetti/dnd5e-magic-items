# Blade of Grass

#### Attributes

_Weapon (longsword), legendary, requires Attunement_

This magic weapon appears at first glance to be a large grass blade, but when wielded by a capable warrior, it whips into a straight edge and becomes razor-sharp. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the Blade of Grass, and all damage dealt as part of an attack with this weapon ignores damage resistance. Any attack roll made with the Blade of Grass is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. Druids automatically have Proficiency with this weapon.

As a Bonus Action, the sword can be mentally commanded to retract into a green grass cuff on your wrist, flatten and hide under any clothing on your arm or torso, or extend out into a blade in your hand again.

Once per day, you can cast _ensnare_ through the Blade of Grass, requiring no Concentration (Spell Save DC 17).

**Curse.** The Blade of Grass is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when you Attune to it. Attuning to the Blade of Grass curses you until you are targeted by the _remove curse_ spell or similar magic. While cursed, the Blade of Grass attaches itself to your dominant limb and cannot be removed from your body without severing the limb (this ends the curse), and if the sword has not been used to kill at least one creature in the last day, you suffer one level of Exhaustion. Exhaustion suffered by the Blade of Grass cannot be removed until the curse is lifted, or by killing another creature with this blade (removes one level of Exhaustion per creature killed). If you die from Exhaustion while under this curse, your body is consumed by the Blade of Grass, transforming the corpse into a new [grass warrior](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/tree/main/plants/grass-warrior.md) controlled by the Dungeon Master. This grass warrior retains your memories and assumes your physical appearance.

#### Description

Crafted by a reclusive mage obsessed with puns, the Blade of Grass is a powerful magic weapon without equal, capable of slicing through foes as if made of the hardest steel. But the mage infused within the fibers of this sword a deep craving for lethal combat, and the sword imparts this desire on its wielder. If held by a warrior who cannot keep up with its bloodlust, the weapon saps life energy from its owner instead, draining them until they have nothing left to give. At that moment, the blade destroys the body and crafts a replacement of grass and straw, creating a grass warrior.

Even in death, this hollow reflection of the weapon's wielder is not allowed rest, and the warrior spends all their waking hours seeking out worthy opponents in one-on-one duels, as the Blade of Grass wishes to find a capable warrior who will carry it forward to future glory in battle. Once it finds someone capable of defeating its former owner, it transfers to the victor and the cycle begins anew.
