# Mariner's Bow

#### Attributes

_Weapon (shortbow), rare (requires Attunement)_

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Additionally, while aiming with the bow, you can see invisible creatures and objects, and targets do not benefit from partial cover.

#### Description

This shortbow has multiple tiny lenses embedded in the body. These lenses allow the wielder a clearer view of their target, but also are magically enchanted to see through illusions and magical barriers.
