You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon; this bonus increases to +2 when you reach 9th level, and +3 when you reach 16th level. The weapon has the following additional properties.

_**Shared Inspiration.**_ The _Silent Singer_ grants you a portion of Ganu's power and creativity. The rapier has 5 charges that can be spent on some of the weapon's properties. These charges can also be used as Bardic Inspiration, and you can spend and combine them with any uses of Bardic Inspiration you already have from another source. The rapier regains 1d6 charges at dawn, but you can also expend uses of Bardic Inspiration in place of charges.

_**Song of the Blade.**_ Attacks made with the _Silent Singer_ use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of Strength or Dexterity. Additionally, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the _Silent Singer_, you can expend up to 5 charges, roll a number of Bardic Inspiration die equal to the number of charges spent, and choose one of the following secondary effects:

- **Sneak Attack.** You deal additional weapon damage equal to the roll.
- **Mocking Attack.** The target subtracts the number rolled from the next saving throw they make before the start of your next turn.

_**Heroic Knowledge.**_ This relic retains all living knowledge of the hero who inhabits it, and can impart you with knowledge of that hero's adventures in ancient times. Once per day, if you spend 10 minutes touching the relic and mentally communing with the soul within, you can cast the _commune_ spell without any material components, targeting the hero as the divine proxy.

_**Sentience.**_ This relic is a sentient artifact; its alignment and ability scores are listed in its attributes. It is unable to sense its surroundings beyond its wielder. The relic can understand Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. While you are Attuned to this relic, it also understands every language you know.

_**Personality.**_ The _Silent Singer_ contains the soul of Ganu Frightfrightener, a great Hero who voluntarily embodied this weapon to pass on his wisdom to adventurers protecting the Soul Moon. Ganu was a creative soul who was forced by the Incursion of the Hells to relinquish his love of music and art, instead being keyholed into the more "useful" role of a rogue, but his desire to contribute to the act of artistic expression draws the blade to connect with creative individuals.
