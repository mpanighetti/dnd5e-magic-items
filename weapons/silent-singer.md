#### Attributes

_Weapon (rapier), artifact (requires Attunement by a bard)_

You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon; this bonus increases to +2 when you reach 9th level, and +3 when you reach 16th level. Proficiency with a rapier allows you to add your Proficiency Bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with the _Silent Singer_. The rapier has the following additional properties.

_**Heroic Knowledge.**_ The rapier retains all living knowledge of the hero who inhabits it, and can impart you with knowledge of Ganu's adventures in ancient times. Once per day, if you spend 10 minutes touching the rapier and mentally communing with the soul within, you can cast the _commune_ spell without any material components, targeting Ganu as the divine proxy.

_**Shared Inspiration.**_ The _Silent Singer_ grants you a portion of Ganu's power and creativity. The rapier has 5 charges that can be spent on some of the weapon's properties. These charges can also be used as Bardic Inspiration, and you can spend and combine them with any uses of Bardic Inspiration you already have from another source. The rapier regains 1d6 charges at dawn, but you can also expend uses of Bardic Inspiration in place of charges.

_**Song of the Blade.**_ Attacks made with the _Silent Singer_ use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of Strength or Dexterity. Additionally, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the _Silent Singer_, you can expend up to 5 charges, roll a number of Bardic Inspiration die equal to the number of charges spent, and choose one of the following secondary effects:

- **Sneak Attack.** You deal additional weapon damage equal to the roll.
- **Mocking Attack.** The target subtracts the number rolled from the next saving throw they make before the start of your next turn.

_**Sentience.**_ The _Silent Singer_ is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 10. It is unable to sense its surroundings beyond its wielder.

The rapier can understand Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. While you are Attuned to the _Silent Singer_, it also understands every language you know.

_**Personality.**_ The _Silent Singer_ contains the soul of Ganu, a great Hero who voluntarily embodied this weapon to pass on his wisdom to adventurers protecting the Soul Moon. Ganu was a creative soul who was forced by the Incursion of the Hells to relinquish his love of music and art, instead being keyholed into the more "useful" role of a rogue, but his desire to contribute to the act of artistic expression draws the blade to connect with creative individuals.

#### Description

A steel rapier, crafted with brass and onyx, once wielded by the roguish member of the ancient party of Heroes who fought against an incursion of the Hells. The intricacies of this blade befits well the nature of this Hero, a goliath by the name of Ganu.
