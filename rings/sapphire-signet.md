# Sapphire Signet

_Ring, legendary (requires Attunement)_

This ring is carved from animal bone and is inset with a sapphire which displays the Rousseau family seal in platinum lining on its surface.

While Attuned to this ring, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration, and you can cast the _primal savagery_ cantrip.

Additionally, you can cast the _polymorph_ spell through the ring using your spellcasting ability and targeting yourself. While polymorphed, all of your attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance or immunity to attack damage. When selecting a target for an attack while polymorphed by the ring, you must first succeed on a DC 5 Intelligence saving throw, or your target is selected at random from all viable creatures in range as your bestial instincts temporarily take over.

If you do not have the ability to cast spells normally, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability when casting spells through this ring. Once you have cast _polymorph_ using the ring, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

**Curse.** After the _polymorph_ spell ends, the ring glows brightly and infuses you with wild Transmutation magic, subjecting you to a minor curse. While cursed in this manner, whenever you take damage, you must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or you are polymorphed into a sheep for 1 minute. You can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of your turns, ending the polymorph on a successful save. The curse persists even if you end possession of or Attunement to the ring, unless another creature Attunes to it. Otherwise, the curse ends at dawn.
