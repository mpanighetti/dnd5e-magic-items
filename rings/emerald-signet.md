# Emerald Signet

#### Attributes

_Ring, legendary (requires Attunement)_

While Attuned to this ring, any spells you cast that restore Hit Points or add Temporary Hit Points add 1d6 to the total Hit Points gained, and you can cast the _spare the dying_ cantrip.

Additionally, the ring has 3 charges. You can cast spells through the ring using your spellcasting ability, each of which has a charge cost:

- _bless_: 1 charge
- _cure wounds_: 2 charges
- _healing word_: 2 charges
- _lesser restoration_: 3 charges

If you do not have the ability to cast spells normally, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability when casting spells through this ring. The ring regains all its charges at dawn.

**Curse.** The first time a charge has been expended, the ring glows brightly and infuses you with wild Necromancy magic, subjecting you to a minor curse. While cursed in this manner, every time an ally within 30 feet of you takes damage, that damage is split evenly between you and the ally before applying resistance or immunity. Damage you take in this manner cannot be reduced. The curse persists even if you end possession of or Attunement to the ring, unless another creature Attunes to it. Otherwise, the curse ends at dawn.

#### Description

This silver ring is inset with an emerald which displays the Rousseau family seal in platinum lining on its surface.
