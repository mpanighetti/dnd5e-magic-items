# Potion of Allergy Relief

_Potion, Rare_

Some plants contain natural chemicals and compounds that can suppress a creature's allergic reactions when concentrated into a _potion of allergy relief_. These herbs are so rare that they are largely unknown within the Material Plane, and those who have encountered or heard of them often attribute their curative properties to a powerful magic or divine gift. Some worlds may have no such natural remedies at all, or have simply not discovered them yet.

Though the effects of such a potion would only be temporary, for those afflicted by allergies, they are highly sought after. Their ability to suppress the effects of allergens allow adventurers to imbibe them in preparation of a journey where exposure to allergens might be anticipated, such as a lengthy spelunking into moldy caverns, or a planar excursion into the Far Realm.

Even if a given world includes plants with allergy relief properties, they are unlikely to be found in most apothecaries. If one starts seeking out such remedies, there is a 10% chance that herbalists in a given town have _Potions of Allergy Relief_ in stock; otherwise, they can only provide vague guidance as to where the herbs might be found in nature.

When you drink this clear potion, you are subject to the following effects:

- You immediately remove all effects of allergic reactions, including any levels of Exhaustion triggered by allergic reactions.
- For the next week, you automatically succeed in all allergy-triggered saving throws.
- At the end of the first Long Rest you take after drinking this potion, you gain 2d4 + 2 Temporary Hit Points.

#### Crafting

With sufficient time and access to the appropriate raw materials, skilled herbalists can create a _Potion of Allergy Relief_ by using appropriate crafting mechanics as determined by the Dungeon Master. Access to allergy-relieving herbs as raw materials is required to brew this potion. The act of locating and gathering the herbs for processing into a single potion might be the foundation of its own difficult quest.
