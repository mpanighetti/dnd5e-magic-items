# Potion of Life

_Potion (Alchemist's Potion), Size 1 Transmutation_ (Alchemist[^ðŸ§ª] ([House of Abiogenesis](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-classes/blob/main/alchemist/house-of-abiogenesis.md)))

- **Materials:** powdered zinc oxide
- **Duration:** varies

A pale cloud of particles swirls within tiny eddies reverberating through the bottle of clear liquid. The cloud solidifies in your mouth with a slightly chalky texture, and each crunch emits tiny jolts of electricity through your tongue and cheeks. Pairs well with soft cheeses and honeyed desserts.

**Drink (8 Hours).** When you brew this potion, choose the Elemental or Ooze creature type. When a creature drinks this potion, their creature type changes to the type you chose, and they gain 5 Temporary Hit Points.

_Upsizing._ The Temporary Hit Points are increased to five times the potion size.

**Throw (Instantaneous).** When thrown on a Small or Tiny inert nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried, this potion transforms the object into a living creature known as an **alchemist's monster**. The object must be either a clockwork device, a corpse, a sample of an element (air, earth, fire, or water) in a container, slime, or any liquid, or the thrown potion has no effect.

The alchemist's monster's traits are determined by the nature of the object used in its creation. If more than one selection would be applicable, you choose which one is used at the time of the monster's creation. See the monster's full game statistics in the accompanying **[Alchemist's Monster](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/special/alchemists-monster.md)** stat block, which includes the **Object Types** table.

The alchemist's monster is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. In combat, the monster acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a Bonus Action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the monster to take the Attack action. If you are Incapacitated, the monster can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If an alchemist's monster is reduced to 0 Hit Points, or if you use a Potion of Life to create a second monster, the current monster immediately reverts to the original inert object used in its creation. Anything the monster was wearing or carrying is left behind when it reverts to its inert form.

_Upsizing._ At size 2 or bigger, you can apply the potion's thrown effect to a Medium-sized object to create a Medium-sized alchemist's monster with Strength 17 (+3), and at size 3 or bigger, you can apply its thrown effect to a Large-sized object to create a Large-sized monster with Strength 19 (+4). Additionally, an alchemist's monster created by throwing this potion gains increased abilities based on the potion size (as described in its stat block).
